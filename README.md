# Recursion-Project
A project in which we implemented several functions recursively (as well as iteratively in a few cases) to learn recursion

Skipped the iterative maze function though, that one was optional and it was so rough that they allowed you to assume that you could solve the maze by placing your hand on the left wall the entire time for that version (or something similar to that)

(Late addendum) Pretty sure the square root functions are busted. Oh well. I was learning.
